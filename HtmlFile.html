      Introduction to HTML
    </li>
      <h2>HTML was created by tim berners-Lee in 1999 and latest version is HTML 5.
         It is the most basic language and simple to learn and modify. HTML also defines the 
        structure of web pages, means we can create a website using html which can be viewed on
      internet-connected devices like laptops, android mobile phones, etc.</h2>

     <li style="font-size:300%;">Definition of html</li>
     <h2>HTML stands for: Hypertext Markup Languge. It basically refers to a text that is being
       stored in a computer system that allows the user to move from one piece of text or document
        to another as figure out below.</h2>

     <h2>But here let's breakdown the term "HTML" to see what exactly it refers to!<br>
    <b>HTML</b> means Hypertext Markup Languge as said above, but what does that means?
    <ul><li>Hypertext</li>
      refers to the text that is not restricted to a sequential format and that includes links to
       other text.
       The links can connect online pages inside a single or different websites.<li>Markup Language</li>
       is a language that is interpreted by the browser and it defines the elements within a document
       using "tags". It is also human-readable, which means that markup files use common words rather than
       the complicated syntax of programming languges.
