      HTTP: The Foundation of Web Communication
    </h1>
    <p>
      <strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) </strong>is the core protocol
      that governs how data is exchanged between web clients (like browsers) and
      web servers over the internet. It's essentially the communication system
      that allows users to view and interact with websites.
    </p>
    <h3>How HTTP Works</h3>
    <p>
      HTTP operates on a <mark>request-response</mark> model. Here’s the basic
      flow:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Client Request:</strong> When you enter a website’s URL or click
        a link, your browser (the client) sends an HTTP request to the server
        hosting that website. This request typically includes the desired
        resource (e.g., a web page or image) and additional information like the
        type of browser and data format it can accept.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Server Response:</strong> The server processes the request and
        sends back an HTTP response. This usually includes the requested content
        (HTML, images, etc.) or, if something goes wrong, an error message (such
        as a "404 Not Found").
      </li>
    </ol>

        style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 60%; height: auto"
      />
    </div>
    <h3>Key Components of HTTP</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Methods:</strong> HTTP defines several request methods, each
        specifying a different action:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>GET:</strong> Retrieve data from a server (e.g., load a web
          page).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>POST:</strong> Send data to a server (e.g., submit a form).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>PUT:</strong> Update or replace existing data on a server.
        </li>
        <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Remove data from a server.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>HEAD:</strong> Retrieve only the headers of a response (useful
          for checking metadata).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>OPTIONS:</strong> Get information about the communication
          options available for a resource.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <strong>URLs:</strong> Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are the
        addresses of web resources. When you request a web page, the URL tells
        the server exactly what content you’re looking for.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Headers:</strong> HTTP headers carry metadata about the request
        or response. They can include information like content type (e.g., HTML,
        JSON), caching instructions, or user authentication data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Status Codes:</strong> HTTP responses include status codes that
        indicate whether the request was successful, redirected, or encountered
        an error. Common codes include:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>200 OK:</strong> The request was successful, and the server
          returned the requested content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>404 Not Found:</strong> The requested resource couldn’t be
          found on the server.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>500 Internal Server Error:</strong> The server encountered an
          unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>HTTP and Security</h3>
    <p>
      HTTP, by default, is not secure since the data transmitted between client
      and server is not encrypted. This is where
      <strong>HTTPS</strong> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) comes in.
      HTTPS uses encryption protocols like SSL/TLS to ensure that data exchanged
      between the client and server is secure, protecting against eavesdropping
      or tampering.
    </p>
    <h3>Statelessness of HTTP</h3>
    <p>
      One of HTTP’s defining features is its <mark>stateless</mark> nature. Each
      request made by the client is independent; the server doesn’t retain any
      memory of previous requests. To manage sessions (like staying logged in),
      websites often use cookies or other session management techniques to
      maintain state across multiple HTTP interactions.
