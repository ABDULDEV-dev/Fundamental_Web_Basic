    <p>
      A <strong>web server</strong> is a powerful computer or software
      application responsible for storing, processing, and delivering web
      content to clients over the internet. When you visit a website, the web
      server is what provides you with the data (web pages, images, videos,
      etc.) that make up that site.
    </p>
    <h3>How a Web Server Works</h3>
    <p>
      The primary function of a web server is to respond to requests from a
      <strong> web client </strong> (like a browser). Here’s a simplified
      breakdown of the process:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Client Request:</strong> When you type a website’s URL in your
        browser or click a link, your web client sends an HTTP request to the
        server hosting that website.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Server Processing:</strong> The web server processes the
        request, retrieves the requested resources (like HTML files, images,
        etc.), and prepares them for delivery.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Response:</strong> The server sends back an HTTP response
        containing the requested content. This response is then rendered by the
        web client for you to view and interact with.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div style="text-align: center">
      <img
        src="img/web-server-1.jpg"
        alt="Web Server Diagram"
        style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 60%; height: auto"
      />
    </div>
    <h3>Types of Web Servers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Static Web Servers: </strong>These serve simple, unchanging
        content like HTML pages, images, or downloadable files. The server
        merely retrieves the files and sends them to the client without any
        modification.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dynamic Web Servers:</strong> These handle more complex
        requests, generating content on-the-fly using programming languages like
        PHP, Python, or Java. Dynamic servers are commonly used for sites that
        change based on user input, like social media platforms or e-commerce
        websites.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Key Components of a Web Server</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Hardware:</strong> The physical machine that hosts the web
        server software. It needs to have sufficient resources (CPU, RAM,
        storage) to handle incoming requests efficiently. Many websites are
        hosted on powerful, dedicated servers in data centers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Software:</strong> The web server software processes client
        requests and serves up the right content. Common web server software
        includes:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Apache:</strong> One of the most widely used web servers
          globally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nginx:</strong> Known for its speed and ability to handle
          large volumes of traffic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS):</strong>
          Commonly used on Windows servers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <strong>HTTP Protocol:</strong> The web server relies on the HTTP
        (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with clients. It processes
        <mark>HTTP requests</mark> from clients and returns
        <mark>HTTP responses</mark> containing the requested resources or error
        messages.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Web Server Functions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Hosting Websites:</strong> Web servers host websites by storing
        all the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) and delivering
        them to users when requested.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Request Handling:</strong> The server processes incoming
        requests from clients, retrieves the necessary resources, and sends them
        back as HTTP responses. This includes handling GET and POST requests,
        managing sessions, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security:</strong> Web servers play a key role in securing the
        data they host. Using HTTPS, web servers encrypt data to ensure that
        sensitive information, such as login credentials or payment details, is
        transmitted securely between clients and servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content Delivery:</strong> Web servers often work with CDNs
        (Content Delivery Networks) to deliver large files (like videos or
        images) more quickly by distributing them across multiple locations
        around the world.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Web Server vs. Web Client</h3>
    <p>
      While a <mark>web client</mark> (like a browser) is responsible for
      requesting content and displaying it to the user, the
      <mark>web server</mark> is responsible for storing and serving that
      content. The interaction between the two creates the seamless experience
      we associate with the modern web.
