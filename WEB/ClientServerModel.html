    <h2 style="text-align: center">The Client Server Model</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Client-Server Model</strong> is a fundamental concept in
      network computing, defining how devices (clients) interact with servers to
      access and share data across a network, such as the internet. This
      architecture allows distributed systems to operate efficiently, with each
      component playing a specific role.
    </p>
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Client:</strong> The client is typically a user's device, like a
        computer, smartphone, or tablet, which requests information or services
        from a server. Common examples of clients include web browsers, email
        apps, or any software that sends requests over a network.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Server:</strong> A server is a specialized machine or software
        that stores, processes, and serves data or applications. Servers are
        always online, waiting to respond to client requests. Examples include
        web servers, file servers, or database servers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When a client initiates a request (such as entering a web address in a
      browser), the server processes that request and sends the requested
      resources (like a web page) back to the client. This back-and-forth
      exchange enables most online activities, from browsing websites to using
      cloud-based services.

    <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Request-Response Cycle:</strong> Clients make requests, and
        servers respond. The interaction is often stateless, meaning each
        request is treated independently (like loading a web page), although
        some systems use session tracking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Centralization:</strong> Servers store data centrally, ensuring
        consistency and ease of maintenance. Clients rely on servers to access
        or manipulate this data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scalability:</strong> Servers can handle multiple requests from
        different clients simultaneously. This enables networks to grow and
        accommodate many users without overwhelming individual systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security:</strong> Since data resides on servers, they can
        implement robust security measures to protect sensitive information,
        while clients only interact with the server without accessing critical
        backend systems directly.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Common Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Web Browsing:</strong> When you type a URL into your browser
        (the client), it sends a request to a web server, which responds by
        delivering the website's content.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Email Services:</strong> Email clients like Outlook or Gmail
        send requests to mail servers to retrieve or send messages.
      </li>
      <li>
        F<strong>ile Sharing:</strong> File servers allow clients to upload,
        download, or manage files remotely.
      </li>
    </ul>
