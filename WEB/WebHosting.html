    <p>
      Web hosting is a service that allows individuals, businesses, and
      organizations to make their websites accessible on the internet. It
      provides the storage space, resources, and infrastructure required to
      store website files and serve them to users when they visit a website.
    </p>
    <h3>How Web Hosting Works</h3>
    <p>
      Web hosting providers rent out space on their servers (powerful computers
      that are always connected to the internet) where your website's files
      (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, etc.) are stored. When a user
      enters your website’s URL in their browser, their web client sends a
      request to the hosting server, which retrieves and sends back the
      necessary files to display the website.

    <h3>Types of Web Hosting</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Shared Hosting:</strong> Multiple websites share resources on a
        single server, making it an affordable option for small websites and
        blogs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>VPS Hosting:</strong> Virtual Private Servers offer dedicated
        resources within a shared environment, providing more control and
        scalability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dedicated Hosting:</strong> Entire servers are dedicated to a
        single website, offering maximum performance and customization options.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cloud Hosting:</strong> Websites are hosted on a network of
        virtual servers, ensuring high availability and scalability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Managed Hosting:</strong> A hosting provider takes care of all
        the technical aspects, such as server maintenance, updates, and
        security. This is particularly useful for businesses or individuals who
        don't have the time or expertise to manage a server.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Key Features of Web Hosting Services</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Uptime:</strong> The percentage of time a server is operational
        and accessible. Higher uptime ensures your website is available to users
        when they visit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bandwidth:</strong> The amount of data that can be transferred
        between your website and users. Higher bandwidth allows for faster
        loading times and better user experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Storage:</strong> The amount of space available to store your
        website files, databases, and other resources. Sufficient storage is
        essential for hosting multimedia content and large databases.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security:</strong> Web hosting services provide various security
        features to protect your website from cyber threats, such as malware
        scans, firewalls, SSL certificates, and DDoS protection.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support:</strong> Reliable customer support is crucial for
        resolving technical issues, answering questions, and ensuring your
        website runs smoothly. Look for hosting providers with 24/7 support via
        phone, chat, or email.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Why Web Hosting is Important</h1>
    <p>
      Without web hosting, your website would have nowhere to live, and users
      would be unable to access it. Hosting not only provides storage and
      resources but also ensures that your website is available and performs
      well for visitors. Choosing the right web hosting service impacts your
      website’s speed, reliability, and overall user experience.
    </p>
    <h3>Domain Names and Hosting</h3>
    <p>
      While web hosting provides the server space, a <mark>domain name </mark>is
      the address that users type in to reach your website (e.g.,
      www.kamallkuri.com.ng). Web hosting and domain registration are separate
      services, but most hosting providers also offer domain name registration
      as part of their packages.
